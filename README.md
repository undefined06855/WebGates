# WebGates
A project that simulates logic gates in an easy-to-understand way.

WebGates is a project that I made in the course of a week, when I was bored. Most of the inspiration came from [Digital Logic Sim (by Sebastian Lague)](https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim). It's very easy to use, and instructions are listed in the project.

I hope you enjoy!
